Prompt 1: generate an end to end multiplayer game like minecraft deployable on aws gamelift. The implementation should be serverless and cost effective. Use Dynamodb, RDS for leaderboard, AWS Gamelift for deployment. Generate the code in code_with_q_cli directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I apologize for the timeout. You're right - let's focus on creating a concise summary of the implementation rather than generating all the code at once.

Here's a summary of what we've built so far for the Dharma Craft game:

## Project Structure
We've created the basic directory structure with:
• game-server/ - C++ server implementation for GameLift
• game-client/ - Unity client code
• backend/ - Lambda functions for authentication, matchmaking, etc.
• infrastructure/ - Terraform code for AWS resources
• docs/ - Documentation files

## Key Components Implemented

1. Infrastructure (Terraform)
   • DynamoDB tables for player data, game state, and progress
   • RDS for leaderboards
   • S3 and CloudFront for assets
   • API Gateway and Lambda functions
   • IAM roles and policies

2. Backend (Lambda Functions)
   • Authentication system (login/register)
   • Matchmaking with GameLift
   • Game state persistence
   • Leaderboard functionality

3. Game Server (C++)
   • GameLift integration
   • World chunk management
   • Player state handling
   • Network communication

4. Game Client (Unity C#)
   • Game manager for overall state
   • Network manager for server communication

5. Documentation
   • Architecture overview
   • Game design document
   • Deployment instructions

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation, we should focus on:

1. Game Client Implementation
   • Player controller
   • World rendering
   • UI elements
   • Ability system

2. Game Server Refinement
   • Combat system
   • NPC/Guru interactions
   • World generation

3. Testing
   • Local testing setup
   • Integration testing

Would you like me to focus on implementing any specific part of the system next?

prompt 2: complete the implementation of Game Client Implementation - Player controller


Now I've implemented the core components for the game client's player controller and related systems. Here's what each component does:

## PlayerController.cs
This script handles all player interactions including:
• First-person movement with walking, running, and jumping
• Mouse look controls with camera rotation
• Block interaction (breaking and placing blocks)
• Ability usage (astras and siddhis)
• UI toggling for inventory and ability selection
• Network synchronization of player position and actions

Key features:
• Physics-based movement using Unity's CharacterController
• Raycast-based block interaction
• Cooldown system for abilities and block placement
• Animation integration
• Network communication with the server

## Entity.cs
This script manages all non-player entities in the game world:
• Enemies with AI behavior
• Gurus that teach abilities
• NPCs for interaction
• Health and damage system
• Network synchronization

Key features:
• State machine for different entity behaviors
• Interaction system for player-entity interactions
• Health and damage handling
• Visual indicators for interaction

## WorldManager.cs
This script manages the game world and chunk loading:
• Dynamic chunk loading based on player position
• Entity spawning and management
• Block manipulation
• Network synchronization with the server

Key features:
• Efficient chunk loading/unloading system
• Coordinate conversion between world and chunk space
• Entity tracking and management
• Network communication for world state

## Chunk.cs
This script handles individual chunks of the world:
• Block storage and manipulation
• Mesh generation for rendering
• Collision detection

Key features:
• Efficient mesh generation with face culling
• Block type handling
• Texture atlas support

These components work together to create a complete player experience in the Dharma Craft game, allowing players to move around, interact with the world, use abilities, and engage with entities like gurus and enemies.
