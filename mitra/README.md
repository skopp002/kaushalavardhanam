# Mitra (मित्रम्) — Sanskrit-Speaking Robot on Reachy Mini

Mitra ("friend" in Sanskrit) is an interactive desktop robot built on the **Reachy Mini Lite**. Say **"mitra"** to wake it, show it any object and it names the object in Sanskrit, and converse with it — it understands English, Kannada, or Sanskrit, replies in spoken Sanskrit, and ends every turn with a short question back, so the conversation keeps going instead of stopping at each answer — and if you ask *"explain that in English"*, it explains the exchange in English before returning to Sanskrit. All inference runs **locally** on the host Mac with open-source models; no internet is needed at runtime.

## Architecture

### Option A — fully local inference (v1 target)

![Mitra architecture — fully local](architecture-local.png)

### Option B — cloud-extended inference (speech + wake word stay local)

![Mitra architecture — cloud-extended](architecture-cloud.png)

### What happens when you say "hey mitra" — sequence of execution

![Mitra wake sequence diagram](flow-wake.png)

Time flows downward: messages 1–7 are the wake-and-greet phase; 8–17 are one conversation turn, repeating until 30 seconds of silence puts Mitra back to sleep. The numbers on the Option A/B architecture arrows above mark the same order on the component view.

**Flow in one paragraph:** the robot's microphones stream over USB through the `reachy-mini` SDK to a local **openWakeWord** model listening for "mitra". On wake, the robot nods and greets; **Silero VAD** segments utterances, **Whisper** transcribes them (with language detection across English/Kannada/Sanskrit), and a **Strands Agent** — using the **OllamaModel provider** against a local **Qwen3-VL 8B** (conversation + vision + native tool calling) — produces a short Sanskrit reply. Replies pass a Devanagari validator, get spoken by **AI4Bharat Indic Parler-TTS**, and play through the robot's speaker. Object questions make the model call its `capture_image` tool, with a **human-verified Sanskrit lexicon cache** overriding generated names for accuracy.

**Extending to the cloud (Option B)** is a one-line Strands provider swap — `OllamaModel` → `AnthropicModel`/`BedrockModel`. The agent, tools, prompts, and validator are unchanged; wake word, ASR, and TTS stay on the host so raw microphone audio never leaves it, and the local model remains installed as an offline fallback. Details in [DESIGN.md §1.5](DESIGN.md).

## New to AI? How the Pieces Fit

If words like "model", "Ollama", and "agent" are new to you, read this first — every other document assumes these ideas.

**A model is a file of numbers, not a program (and not a Docker image).** When you run `ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b`, you download ~6 GB of *weights* — billions of numbers learned during training, plus a little metadata. The file does nothing by itself; it can't be "started" any more than a spreadsheet can. Ollama's commands *look* like Docker on purpose (`pull`, `name:tag`, layers with `sha256:` digests, even a "Modelfile") because it borrowed Docker's convenient *distribution* style — but there is no container, no operating system inside, nothing "running in" the model. It's data.

**Ollama is the serving layer — the thing that makes the numbers useful.** `ollama serve` is a small server on your laptop (at `http://localhost:11434`) that loads the weights into memory, runs them on your Mac's GPU, and offers a simple HTTP API: send text in, get generated text back. This is the same shape as ChatGPT or Claude — model weights behind a serving API — except the whole thing lives on your machine. That's the point of Mitra's design: your voice and camera images never leave your laptop.

**The other AI pieces are specialist models, each with its own job:**

| Piece | Job | In one line |
|---|---|---|
| Wake word (openWakeWord) | Hear "mitra" | A tiny always-on model that listens for one word and nothing else — so the big models stay idle (and your privacy stays intact) until you call |
| VAD (Silero) | Detect speech | Notices when you start and stop talking, so we know when an utterance is complete |
| ASR (Whisper) | Speech → text | Turns your audio into written words ("automatic speech recognition") |
| LLM/VLM (Qwen3-VL via Ollama) | Think | The large language model: reads your words (and camera images — the "V" is for vision) and writes the Sanskrit reply |
| TTS (Indic Parler-TTS) | Text → speech | Turns the written Sanskrit into a spoken voice ("text to speech") |

**An "agent" is an LLM that can use tools.** A plain LLM can only write text. The Strands Agents SDK wraps our LLM in a loop where the model may also *call functions we hand it* — Mitra gives it four: `capture_image` (take a photo), `speak_sanskrit` (talk), `nod` (move the head), and `end_session` (go back to sleep). When you ask "what is this?", the model itself decides to call `capture_image`, looks at the frame, and answers. The robot is not an agent and never calls the model — it is the *body* (camera, microphones, speaker, motors); the agent is the *brain*; and a small state machine (the orchestrator) is the *nervous system* connecting them.

## Component Roles — Who Does What, and When

The architecture separates **sound** from **meaning**: everything left of the orchestrator in the diagrams deals in audio, everything right of it deals in text and images. Only one component actually *thinks*. Numbers refer to the sequence diagram above.

**Reachy Mini + `reachy-mini` SDK — the body.** Microphones, camera, speaker, and head motors, reached through the daemon (real robot or simulator — identical API). It contains no intelligence: it streams audio in, plays audio out, moves when told. All hardware access goes through one wrapper (`src/robot/reachy.py`), which is why the same code runs against the simulator and the real robot.

**Wake detector — the gatekeeper ear (steps 2–3).** A deliberately tiny listener that answers one question forever: *"was 'mitra' just said?"* Currently a small Whisper transcribing short bursts of speech and matching the word (no training needed); the production target is a custom openWakeWord model. Its existence is a privacy and efficiency decision: the big models stay idle — and nothing is transcribed or remembered — until you explicitly call the robot's name (मित्र, the vocative of मित्रम्).

**VAD / segmenter — the utterance chopper (step 9).** Watches the audio stream for the moment you start and stop talking, and hands over exactly one complete utterance. Without it, ASR wouldn't know where a sentence begins or ends. An energy gate that self-calibrates to your room's noise floor, with Silero VAD as the higher-quality engine.

**ASR (Whisper) — ears to text (step 10).** Converts the utterance's sound into the literal written words, in whatever language and script you spoke — nothing more. It doesn't understand, remember, or answer; it is the adapter between the microphone and the language model, which cannot hear. *Why is this needed at all?* Because our model is a **vision**-language model — "V" means images, not audio. Speech-native "omni" models exist that would ingest audio directly, but today they can't run locally, don't speak Sanskrit, and would bypass the text stage where our correctness guardrails live — so ASR stays (see DESIGN.md).

**Language detector — the tag writer.** A few lines of script-range heuristics that label the transcript `en`, `kn`, or `sa`, so the model is told what it's reading and per-turn logs record the language mix.

**Orchestrator — the nervous system.** A state machine (ASLEEP → WAKING → LISTENING → THINKING → SPEAKING) that routes everything and owns the guardrails. Two paths are deliberately *deterministic* — the nod on wake, and every reply passing through the validator before being spoken — so the quality of the model never decides whether the safety checks run. It has no intelligence either; it is traffic control.

**Strands Agent — the brain's harness (step 11).** Wraps the LLM in an agentic loop and hands it four tools it may call: `capture_image`, `speak_sanskrit`, `nod`, `end_session`. It also owns conversation memory for the session and abstracts the model provider — swapping local Ollama for a cloud model (Option B) is a one-line change here, and nothing else in the system notices.

**Qwen3-VL via Ollama — the only thinker (steps 12–13).** Idle until a transcript arrives; then it reads the tagged text plus the session history plus its Sanskrit-only instructions, optionally calls `capture_image` and *looks at the frame itself* (the same model does vision — there is no separate image recognizer), and composes the Sanskrit reply. Ollama is its serving layer: the local server that holds the ~6 GB of weights on the GPU and answers HTTP requests. One invocation per utterance; everything else in the system exists to feed it clean input or discipline its output.

**Validator + lexicon — the discipline (step 14).** The validator checks each reply really is Devanagari-dominant and short, retrying once with a corrective prompt, then falling back to a safe phrase — a cheap guard against a small local model drifting into English. The lexicon is the accuracy backstop: once a human verifies an object's Sanskrit name, the stored name **always overrides** whatever the model generates, and new model-coined names are queued for review (`mitra-lexicon`). This is the main compensation for local-model Sanskrit quality.

**TTS (Indic Parler-TTS) — text to voice (steps 15–16).** Turns the validated Devanagari sentence into a spoken waveform (Sanskrit is its top-rated language), which the robot's speaker plays. If the gated model isn't accessible yet it falls back automatically to an ungated Hindi VITS voice. Like ASR in reverse — and like ASR, it neither understands nor invents anything.

## Run in Simulation (no robot needed)

The `reachy-mini` SDK ships a **MuJoCo simulation backend**: the daemon started with `--sim` behaves exactly like a real Reachy Mini Lite on USB — same localhost daemon, same `ReachyMini()` client. Because all hardware access in Mitra goes through `src/robot/reachy.py`, the entire pipeline runs unmodified against the simulator; only which daemon is running changes.

**What maps where:** head motion (`nod`) animates in the MuJoCo viewer; `capture_image` returns frames rendered from the simulated robot's viewpoint (the `minimal` scene includes an apple, a croissant, and a duck on a table — *एतत् सेवफलम् अस्ति* is testable today); microphone and speaker map to the **Mac's own audio devices**, so the full wake-word → VAD → Whisper → Parler-TTS chain runs for real through laptop audio (software echo cancellation via GStreamer replaces the robot's XMOS hardware AEC). Not represented in sim: the Lite's 2-mic far-field acoustics (FR-1.4 accuracy targets), real camera optics/lighting, the 5 W speaker, and sound-source localization — those remain hardware checks in Phases 0–1.

### Setup (macOS)

> **⚠️ Always create and activate the project venv first.** The system `pip`/`python3` on macOS are often broken or too old (Python ≥3.10 is required); every install and run below assumes the venv is active — re-activate it in every new terminal.

1. **Environment** (from this `mitra/` directory; uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to provision Python 3.12 if the system lacks it):

   ```bash
   cd mitra
   uv venv .venv --python 3.12
   source .venv/bin/activate        # do this in every new terminal
   ```

2. **Install the SDK with the simulation extra** (Pollen recommends plain `pip` over `uv` on macOS for the MuJoCo packages):

   ```bash
   pip install "reachy-mini[mujoco]"
   ```

3. **Start the simulated robot.** On macOS the MuJoCo GUI requires the `mjpython` launcher (Linux/Windows use `reachy-mini-daemon --sim` instead):

   ```bash
   mjpython -m reachy_mini.daemon.app.main --sim --scene minimal
   ```

   A 3D viewer opens (drag to rotate, scroll to zoom). Keep this terminal running — it is the daemon. Verify at <http://localhost:8000/docs>.

   > **Gotcha:** if `mjpython` segfaults in `libgstpython.dylib`, rename that GStreamer plugin so it isn't auto-loaded (official workaround; doesn't affect audio/video):
   >
   > ```bash
   > mv $(python -c "import gstreamer_python, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(gstreamer_python.__file__).parent / 'lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstpython.dylib')") \
   >    $(python -c "import gstreamer_python, pathlib; print(pathlib.Path(gstreamer_python.__file__).parent / 'lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstpython_.dylib')")
   > ```

4. **Smoke test** (second terminal, same venv) — exercises the exact primitives Mitra's tools wrap:

   ```python
   from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
   from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

   with ReachyMini() as mini:              # auto-connects to the sim daemon on localhost
       # "nod" — what robot.head.nod() wraps
       mini.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(z=20, roll=10, mm=True, degrees=True), duration=0.5)
       mini.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(), duration=0.5)

       # "capture_image" — frame of the MuJoCo scene, numpy (H, W, 3) uint8
       frame = mini.media.get_frame()
       print("camera frame:", frame.shape, frame.dtype)
   ```

5. **Switching to hardware:** plug in the Reachy Mini Lite over USB and run `reachy-mini-daemon` (no `--sim`). The same code connects to the real robot.

## Testing on the Real Reachy Mini Lite

Because all hardware access goes through `src/robot/reachy.py`, switching from simulator to hardware is a one-line change — no Mitra code differs. Two things *do* differ physically: the camera and microphones are now the **robot's own** USB devices (not your Mac's), and the motors need real power.

1. **Power and connect:** plug the **7 V/5 A power supply** into the robot (USB alone does not power the motors — the most common "robot won't move" cause) and connect the USB data cable to your Mac. If you have Reachy Mini Control installed, quit it — it and a manually-run daemon can't hold the robot at the same time.

2. **Start the real daemon** (no `mjpython`, no `--sim` — this replaces the simulator terminal):

   ```bash
   source .venv/bin/activate
   reachy-mini-daemon
   ```

   Verify at <http://localhost:8000/docs>. Unlike the simulator logs, you should **not** see `No Reachy Mini Audio USB device found!` — if you do, the daemon isn't seeing the robot's audio board; unplug/replug the USB cable and restart the daemon.

3. **Run the existing hardware smoke tests unmodified** — same file, same assertions, now against real hardware:

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/hw/ -v -s
   ```

   Watch the physical robot for `test_nod_moves_head` and listen for `test_speaker_tone`; `test_camera_frame` saves a real photo of whatever the robot is pointed at. If a motor test fails with "Missing motor" or "Overload Error", see Pollen's [motor diagnosis guide](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/blob/main/docs/source/troubleshooting/motors_diagnosis.md) — don't touch the robot's head while it's moving.

4. **Re-check the wake gate for the robot's real mic** (it has different gain than your Mac's built-in mic):

   ```bash
   .venv/bin/python scripts/wake_probe.py
   ```

   **If "hey mitra" still doesn't trigger,** record one clip and replay it offline instead of guessing live — this isolates mic-volume problems from mis-transcription problems, and shows exactly what Whisper heard:

   ```bash
   python scripts/test_audio.py --record 3 --out clips/hello.wav --analyze
   ```

   Prints the clip's RMS/peak against the speech gate, what the wake detector (whisper-tiny) transcribed and whether it matched, and what the main ASR (whisper-large-v3-turbo) heard. Re-run `--file clips/hello.wav` anytime to test detector tuning without re-recording; it also accepts recordings from anywhere else (e.g. a phone voice memo).

5. **Run Mitra for real:**

   ```bash
   python main.py --debug
   ```

   Say **"hey mitra"** at conversational distance (≤ 2 m, per FR-1.4) — this is the first time the acceptance criteria deferred from simulation (wake accuracy, real camera optics/lighting, actual speaker volume, sound-source acoustics) are actually measurable. Everything else — the conversation tests, vision turns, barge-in, "explain in English" — follows the same steps as in simulation.

## Running

### System requirements

| Requirement | Why |
|---|---|
| **Apple Silicon Mac** (M1 or later; M1 Max is the reference machine) | The stack is built on Apple's GPU: Ollama uses Metal, ASR uses MLX (Apple-Silicon-only), TTS runs on MPS. Intel Macs and Rosetta builds fall back to CPU — replies take ~60 s instead of ~3 s |
| **32 GB unified memory recommended** (16 GB minimum, expect memory pressure) | ~11.5 GB of models stay resident while running: Qwen3-VL ~6 GB + Whisper ~3 GB + TTS ~2 GB + wake/VAD (REQUIREMENTS §3) |
| **~20 GB free disk** | One-time model downloads (LLM 6 GB, Whisper 3 GB, TTS 2 GB, small models) plus the ~5 GB venv |
| **Python 3.10–3.12** in a project venv | reachy-mini supports 3.10–3.12; macOS system Python is too old |
| **Internet for setup only** | Model downloads are one-time; at runtime the pipeline is fully offline |
| **Microphone permission** for your terminal app | macOS will prompt on first mic access; without it the wake word hears silence |

### One-time installation

Everything below assumes the venv is active (`source .venv/bin/activate` — see Setup above).

```bash
cd mitra
pip install -e '.[agent,wake,vad,asr,sanskrit]'  # agent + speech-input + grammar layers
pip install torch transformers git+https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts.git   # Sanskrit TTS
ollama pull qwen3-vl:8b-instruct                # the LLM (~6 GB, one time)
```

**Sanskrit grammar data** (one time — ~78 MB, lives outside git). Every reply is
checked against a real inflected lexicon rather than a list of banned words
(DESIGN §5); the same fetch also indexes the Cologne dictionaries used by the
lexicon review CLI:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_sanskrit_data.py          # vidyut morphology + Cologne dicts
python3 scripts/build_dictionary.py             # index MW/Apte for mitra-lexicon
```

Skip it and Mitra runs exactly as before, logging one warning at startup and
falling back to the Devanagari-ratio check alone.

**Corpora.** The verse corpus for *"recite a shloka"* (`data/shlokas.json`, 500
public-domain verses) is committed, so a fresh clone can recite with no extra
step. The conversational phrasebook is **not** — the source is copyrighted, so
`data/daily.pdf` and `data/phrasebook.jsonl` are gitignored. Copy them from a
machine that has them, or rebuild with `python3 scripts/build_phrasebook.py
data/daily.pdf`. Without it Mitra still talks; replies are just ungrounded, and
startup says so.

**Unlock the Sanskrit voice** (one time — the TTS model is a *gated* Hugging Face repo with automatic approval):

1. Create a free account at [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/join) if you don't have one.
2. While logged in, open [ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts) and click **"Agree and access repository"** — access is granted instantly.
3. Create a *read* token at [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) and log the machine in: `hf auth login` (paste the token when prompted).

When it worked, the model page shows this badge instead of the request form — that's your goal state:

![Gated model access granted on Hugging Face](images/accepted-gated-model-access-on-hf.png)

Skip this and Mitra still speaks: it automatically falls back to an ungated Hindi VITS voice (`facebook/mms-tts-hin`) that reads Devanagari — intelligible, but its Sanskrit pronunciation is approximate. The console warns when the fallback is in use.

> **⚠️ Ollama must be the native Apple Silicon build.** Install the official app from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download). An Intel-Homebrew Ollama at `/usr/local` runs under Rosetta with **no GPU access** — replies take ~60 s instead of ~3 s. Verify with `ollama ps` after a query: it must say `100% GPU`.
>
> **⚠️ Use the `:8b-instruct` tag, not `:8b`.** The bare tag is the *thinking* variant — it burns the latency budget on hidden reasoning and returns empty replies.

### Talking to Mitra — three processes

| Where | Command | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Terminal 1 | `mjpython -m reachy_mini.daemon.app.main --sim --scene minimal` | The **robot**: simulator daemon + MuJoCo viewer window. With a real Reachy Mini Lite on USB, run `reachy-mini-daemon` instead — nothing else changes. |
| Ollama app, or Terminal 2 | open the Ollama menu-bar app (it runs the server itself), or run `ollama serve` | The **LLM serving layer** on `localhost:11434` |
| Terminal 3 | `python main.py --debug` | **Mitra**: wake word, ears, brain wiring, voice |

Remember `source .venv/bin/activate` in every terminal. When all three are up: say **"hey mitra"** near the microphone → the robot nods and greets you with नमस्ते → speak English, Kannada, or Sanskrit → it replies in spoken Sanskrit.

**Reading Mitra's body language** (state gestures, `robot.gestures` in config, on by default): antennas perk up and head lifts = *listening, your turn*; head tilts sideways = *thinking about what you said*; face forward = *speaking*; head and antennas droop = *asleep, say "hey mitra" to wake*. Plus the quick nod at the moment the wake word is recognized. Identical on the simulator and the real robot — the pose angles live in `ReachyRobot.POSES` (`src/robot/reachy.py`) if you want to tune the personality. In simulation, the robot's microphone and speaker are your Mac's, and its camera sees the simulated table (duck, croissant, apple — all three have verified lexicon entries).

> **First run is slow — by design, up front.** At startup Mitra *warms up* its speech models: it runs each ASR engine once on silence so the one-time downloads (whisper-tiny for the wake word, then Whisper large-v3-turbo, ~1.6 GB, for transcription) happen right away with a "warming up" log line — instead of silently stalling your first question for minutes. The TTS voice (~2 GB) still downloads on the first reply. After these one-time downloads the whole pipeline is local — it works with Wi-Fi off (the design goal).

### Just want to talk to it in English? (`tests/mini_conversation_app.py`)

Mitra's full pipeline always replies in Sanskrit — that's the point of the project, not a bug. If you'd rather have a plain English conversation with the robot with no Devanagari involved, there's a separate, minimal standalone script for exactly that. It's additive: it doesn't touch or replace anything in Mitra's own pipeline (no lexicon, no Devanagari validator), but it's a real little robot app rather than a bare mic test — it reuses Mitra's wake word, mic capture, VAD, ASR, and LLM connection as plain library calls, keeps the same body language (nod on wake, listening/thinking/speaking poses, back to sleep after 30 s of silence), and gives the LLM the `capture_image` tool so you can hold something up and ask what it is. Speech output is macOS's built-in `say` engine — the child-like **Junior** voice, no TTS model download — synthesized on the Mac and played through the *robot's* speaker, the same output path Mitra uses.

Setup: nothing beyond the main setup above — same virtualenv (if `python main.py --check` passes you're set), same Ollama model (`qwen3-vl:8b-instruct`) on `localhost:11434`, same daemon:

```bash
# terminal 1 (if not already running)
reachy-mini-daemon                       # or the --sim command from above

# terminal 2
source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/mini_conversation_app.py
```

Say **"hey mitra"**, then just talk — plain English in, plain English out; show it an object and ask "what am I holding?" to exercise the camera. Useful as a quick sanity check of the wake/mic/LLM chain on its own, or as a starting template if you want to build something that isn't Sanskrit-focused on top of the same plumbing — the knobs are constants at the top of the file: `WAKE_PHRASE`, `VOICE` (`say -v '?'` lists every installed voice), `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, and the Ollama model id.

> **Note:** listens through the Mac's own built-in microphone rather than the robot's, since the robot's onboard mic currently returns silence on macOS 26 (Tahoe) due to a Core Audio regression affecting multichannel USB audio devices ([pollen-robotics/reachy_mini#820](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini/issues/820) — not specific to this project). Camera, speaker, and head motion are unaffected and still go through the robot normally. Set `robot.mic_source: robot` back in `config.yaml` once that's fixed upstream.

### Development commands

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest              # 59 tests; tests/hw/ auto-skips without a daemon
.venv/bin/python main.py --check        # what's installed / is Ollama up / lexicon count
mitra-lexicon --db data/lexicon.db      # review model-generated Sanskrit names (FR-2.5)
```

## Status

Implemented and verified: orchestrator state machine, robot wrapper (+`FakeReachy`), agent tools, validator, lexicon store (53-entry seed), language detector, wake engines (ASR-transcript now; openWakeWord once the custom "mitra" model is trained), `main.py` wiring — 59 tests green, including live-simulator smoke tests. Live-verified on the M1 Max: Strands agent → Ollama (`qwen3-vl:8b-instruct`, 100% GPU) answers English/Kannada/Sanskrit input with valid Devanagari Sanskrit in ~3 s warm. Remaining Phase 1–4 work: train the custom wake model, verify Parler-TTS latency on MPS, Sanskrit-ASR evaluation, and the seed-lexicon review by a Sanskrit reviewer (FR-2.6).

Predecessor feasibility study (edge Jetson / AWS Bedrock design) is preserved in git history: `git show 40639db:mitra/README.md`.
