"""Per-utterance language detection for en/kn/sa (FR-3.1).

Script-range heuristic over the ASR transcript: Kannada block → kn, Devanagari
block → sa, Latin letters → en; majority wins. The ASR engine's own language
tag is used only as a tie-break hint when the text carries no letters at all.
Whisper labels Sanskrit as Hindi more often than not, so a Devanagari-dominant
transcript is treated as Sanskrit regardless of the hint.
