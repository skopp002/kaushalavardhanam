"""Orchestrator state machine (DESIGN §3–§4).

States: ASLEEP → WAKING → LISTENING → THINKING → SPEAKING → LISTENING … → ASLEEP.

Single-threaded core: all transitions happen in ``handle_event`` on the run
loop's thread. Two daemon helpers — the audio pump and the playback watcher —
communicate with the core only by putting events on the queue (DESIGN §3).
Tests drive ``handle_event`` directly with fakes; ``run()`` adds the threads.

The agent may call tools itself, but four paths stay deterministic regardless
of model quality (DESIGN §1.4): ``nod`` fires here on wake, unintelligible
transcripts are refused here before the model ever sees them, a request to
recite a shloka is answered from the verse corpus without consulting the model
at all, and every generated reply passes the validator and is spoken here.
