# Mitram — Sanskrit-Speaking Interactive Robot on Reachy Mini

**Status:** Requirements | **Version:** 1.2 (2026-07-08) | **Predecessor:** earlier `mitram/` design study (Cohort 3, in git history at `40639db`)

Mitram (मित्रम्, "friend") is an interactive desktop robot built on the **Reachy Mini Lite**. It wakes when someone says **"mitram"**, recognizes objects shown to its camera and names them in Sanskrit, and holds simple conversations — understanding English, Kannada, or Sanskrit, but always replying in Sanskrit.

**v1.1 change:** inference is **local-first with open-source models** on the host Mac. Cloud APIs are an optional, config-gated fallback that is disabled by default — the robot must be fully functional with no internet access after models are downloaded.

**v1.2 change:** primary LLM/vision model switched from Gemma 3 12B to **Qwen3-VL 8B Instruct** — Qwen3-VL exposes **native tool calling through Ollama** (Gemma 3 does not), is multimodal, and is smaller (~6 GB vs ~8 GB resident). See DESIGN.md §1.4.

## 1. Decisions from Requirements Discussion

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Robot platform | **Reachy Mini Lite** (wired), tethered to the host that runs the pipeline |
| Host hardware | **MacBook Pro, Apple M1 Max, 32 GB unified memory** (macOS, Metal/MPS acceleration) |
| AI stack | **Local open-source models for all inference** — LLM, vision, ASR, TTS, wake word. Optional cloud fallback (e.g. Claude API) only if explicitly configured; assume unavailable |
| Language behavior | **Bilingual bridge** — user may speak English, Kannada, or Sanskrit; robot always responds in Sanskrit |
| Object recognition | **Open vocabulary** — a local vision-language model names anything shown; Sanskrit name generated on the fly |
| Motion | **Minimal** — wake acknowledgment gesture only; no expressive/idle animation in v1 |
| Runtime | No fixed preference — chosen per component (§6): Ollama for LLM/VLM, whisper.cpp/MLX for ASR, HF Transformers for TTS |
| Codebase | Fresh code in this directory; reuse concepts from the earlier design (orchestrator, language detection, logging, test structure) |

## 2. Goals

1. Hands-free activation via the spoken wake word "mitram", processed **locally** — no audio ever leaves the host.
2. Show the robot any everyday object → it speaks the object's Sanskrit name in a short sentence (e.g. *एतत् सेवफलम् अस्ति* — "this is an apple").
3. Conversational exchange: user speaks English, Kannada, or Sanskrit; Mitram replies in simple, grammatically correct spoken Sanskrit.
4. **Fully offline operation** after initial model downloads — no internet required at runtime.
5. End-to-end spoken response in **≤ 8 s** for conversation, **≤ 10 s** for vision queries on the M1 Max host (see §8).

### Non-Goals (v1)

- No manipulation/locomotion (Reachy Mini has none) and no expressive animation beyond wake acknowledgment.
- No dependence on cloud quality: local Sanskrit generation will be weaker than frontier cloud models; v1 accepts this and mitigates via prompting and a curated cache (§9 R1) rather than requiring an API.
- No Vedic recitation/chandas awareness; classical simple Sanskrit only.
- No multi-user speaker identification.

## 3. Hardware & Host Platform

| Component | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Robot | Reachy Mini Lite: wide-angle camera, 2 microphones, 5 W speaker, 6-DOF head + body rotation, USB connection to host. Requires external computer (macOS or Linux). |
| Host | MacBook Pro **M1 Max, 32 GB unified memory** (development + deployment target). The model set in §6 is sized to fit ~14 GB of inference memory, leaving headroom for macOS and the pipeline. Other hosts must offer ≥ 16 GB free memory for the same models. |
| Network | Required only for initial model downloads. Runtime is offline. |
| SDK | `reachy-mini` Python SDK (PyPI). Camera frames arrive as numpy arrays; audio via the SDK's default media backend (OpenCV + sounddevice). |

### Memory budget (resident, approximate)

| Model | Quant/format | Memory |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen3-VL 8B Instruct (LLM + vision + tools) | Q4_K_M via Ollama | ~6 GB |
| Whisper large-v3 (ASR) | GGML/MLX | ~3 GB |
| Indic Parler-TTS (~880 M) | fp16, MPS | ~2 GB |
| openWakeWord + Silero VAD | onnx | < 0.5 GB |
| **Total** | | **~11.5 GB of 32 GB** |

## 4. Functional Requirements

### FR-1 Wake Word ("mitram")
- FR-1.1 A local, always-on wake-word engine listens on the robot's microphones for "mitram". Candidate engines: **openWakeWord** (open-source, custom word trainable from synthetic speech) or **Picovoice Porcupine** (custom keyword; note: not fully open-source — acceptable only if openWakeWord misses targets). Decision in Phase 1 based on measured accuracy.
- FR-1.2 No audio leaves the host at any time; the entire pipeline is local.
- FR-1.3 On detection, the robot acknowledges with a **single brief head motion (nod)** and a short Sanskrit greeting (e.g. *नमस्ते*), then enters listening mode.
- FR-1.4 Target: ≥ 90 % detection rate at conversational distance (≤ 2 m), ≤ 1 false accept per hour of ambient household audio.
- FR-1.5 The session ends after a configurable silence timeout (default 30 s) or on a spoken farewell; the robot returns to wake-word-only listening.

### FR-2 Object Recognition & Sanskrit Naming
- FR-2.1 When the user shows an object and asks about it (in any supported language — e.g. "what is this?", *किम् एतत्?*), the host captures a camera frame and sends it to the **local vision-language model** (Qwen3-VL 8B multimodal, §6) with a prompt requesting: object identification, its Sanskrit name in Devanagari, IAST transliteration, and a one-sentence Sanskrit reply.
- FR-2.2 **Open vocabulary:** any object may be shown. The model generates the Sanskrit name; for objects without an attested classical name, it must prefer an established modern-Sanskrit coinage and say so honestly rather than invent silently.
- FR-2.3 The spoken answer is a short Sanskrit sentence naming the object; the console/log shows Devanagari + IAST + English gloss for the operator.
- FR-2.4 If no object is discernible in frame, Mitram says so in Sanskrit and asks the user to hold the object closer.
- FR-2.5 A locally cached, operator-editable lexicon of previously named objects is maintained so repeat objects answer faster and consistently. With a local 12B model this cache is also the primary **accuracy** mechanism: once a name is verified by a human, the cached name always wins over fresh generation.
- FR-2.6 The lexicon ships pre-seeded with ~100 verified everyday objects (fruit, utensils, toys, animals, body parts) so the most common show-and-tell items are correct from day one.

### FR-3 Sanskrit Conversation (Bilingual Bridge)
- FR-3.1 Input languages: English, Kannada, Sanskrit (auto-detected per utterance; concept reused from the earlier `language_detector`).
- FR-3.2 Output language: **Sanskrit only**, regardless of input language. Register: simple, short sentences (laukika Sanskrit), suitable for learners; avoid heavy sandhi and rare vocabulary.
- FR-3.3 Conversation state (multi-turn context) is kept for the duration of a wake session.
- FR-3.4 The system prompt constrains the local LLM to: reply in Sanskrit; keep replies ≤ 2 short sentences; use a **few-shot block of verified Sanskrit exchanges** (local models need stronger steering than frontier models); never switch to English speech (English may appear only in logs).
- FR-3.5 A post-generation **validation pass** checks output is Devanagari-dominant and within length limits; on failure, one retry with a corrective prompt, then a fixed safe fallback phrase. (Cheap guard against a small model drifting into English or rambling.)
- FR-3.6 Configurable "explain mode" (off by default): after the Sanskrit reply, optionally append an English gloss in text logs only — never spoken.

### FR-4 Speech Pipeline
- FR-4.1 **VAD:** Silero VAD segments user utterances after wake.
- FR-4.2 **ASR:** local Whisper large-v3 (via whisper.cpp or mlx-whisper for Metal acceleration) covers English and Kannada; Sanskrit uses a Sanskrit fine-tune (Whisper-Sanskrit transfer-learning checkpoints / AI4Bharat IndicWhisper lineage) run via HF Transformers on MPS. Sanskrit ASR is **experimental** — see Risks (§9).
- FR-4.3 **TTS:** **AI4Bharat Indic Parler-TTS** — Sanskrit is one of its 21 supported languages with the highest native-speaker evaluation score (99.79) among them. Runs on MPS; one fixed voice chosen for warmth/clarity. Fallback if MPS latency is unacceptable: AI4Bharat **Indic-TTS** (VITS-based, lighter, also supports Sanskrit).
- FR-4.4 All spoken output plays through the robot's speaker; all input comes from the robot's microphones (not the laptop's).

### FR-5 Motion (Minimal)
- FR-5.1 Wake acknowledgment: single nod via the `reachy-mini` SDK.
- FR-5.2 Optional (stretch, off by default): face the sound source when woken, using the SDK's sound-localization support if available on Lite's 2-mic array.
- FR-5.3 No other motion in v1. Motion code must be isolated behind a small interface so expressive behaviors can be added later without touching the pipeline.

### FR-6 Orchestration
- FR-6.1 A single **orchestrator** owns the state machine: `ASLEEP → WAKING → LISTENING → THINKING → SPEAKING → LISTENING … → ASLEEP`.
- FR-6.2 The agent layer is built on the **Strands Agents SDK** (core `strands` package) using its **Ollama model provider** — so the same orchestration code runs against local models, and could point at a cloud provider later without rework. Robot capabilities are exposed as **custom Strands tools**: `capture_image()`, `speak_sanskrit(text)`, `nod()`, `end_session()`. Note: the `strands-robots` lab package targets LeRobot arms (SO-100/SO-101) with VLA manipulation policies and does **not** support Reachy Mini — we use core Strands only, wrapping the `reachy-mini` SDK ourselves. If Strands proves heavier than needed, fallback is a plain tool-use loop against the Ollama API; the tool interface is identical either way.
- FR-6.3 **Optional cloud fallback (disabled by default):** if an API key is configured, the orchestrator may route Sanskrit generation to a cloud model when local validation (FR-3.5) fails twice. No key configured → the feature does not exist at runtime; nothing else depends on it.
- FR-6.4 Errors (model timeout, ASR failure, camera error) produce a short spoken Sanskrit apology (e.g. *क्षम्यताम्, पुनः वदतु*) and a logged diagnostic; the session continues.

### FR-7 Logging & Observability
- FR-7.1 Structured per-turn logs: timestamps, detected language, ASR transcript, LLM prompt/response, TTS text (Devanagari + IAST), per-stage latency and memory. (Concept reused from the earlier `logging_subsystem`.)
- FR-7.2 A `--debug` console mode mirrors the conversation live with English glosses for the operator.
- FR-7.3 No audio recordings persisted by default; opt-in flag for collecting evaluation clips.

Everything runs on the host; the runtime has no network dependency.

## 6. Technology Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Robot SDK | `reachy-mini` (PyPI) | Camera → numpy frames; audio I/O; head motion |
| Wake word | openWakeWord (primary) / Porcupine (alt) | Custom "mitram" model; local |
| VAD | Silero VAD | Local, lightweight |
| ASR | Whisper large-v3 via **whisper.cpp / mlx-whisper** (en, kn) + Sanskrit fine-tune via HF Transformers (MPS) | All local |
| LLM + vision | **Qwen3-VL 8B Instruct (multimodal), Q4 via Ollama** — one model serves conversation, open-vocab object naming, and **native tool calling** | Alternatives to evaluate in Phase 3: Qwen3-VL 32B Q4 (~20 GB, quality escalation but memory-tight), Gemma 3 12B (strong multilingual but no native tool calling in Ollama → needs orchestrator-mediated tools) |
| TTS | AI4Bharat **Indic Parler-TTS** (HF Transformers, MPS); fallback AI4Bharat Indic-TTS (VITS) | Sanskrit supported, top-rated language in Parler-TTS eval; local |
| Agent framework | Strands Agents SDK (core) with **Ollama provider** | Robot actions as tools (FR-6.2) |
| Language | Python 3.11+ | Matches Reachy SDK and prior code |

## 7. Reuse from the Earlier `mitram/` Design (git history, `40639db`)

Reuse as **concepts/ported modules**, not dependencies: orchestrator state-machine design, `language_detector` approach, `logging_subsystem` structure, `audio_io` patterns, and the pytest layout in the old `mitram/tests/`. The AWS-specific code (`nova_sonic_client`, `nova_vision_client`, `translation_bridge`) is superseded — the local LLM generates Sanskrit directly, so **no translation bridge is needed**. Notably, the earlier study judged edge-only Sanskrit infeasible on a 16 GB Jetson; the M1 Max with 32 GB unified memory and 2026-era open models (multimodal 12B at Q4, Sanskrit-capable TTS) changes that calculus, though Sanskrit *quality* remains the top risk (§9 R1).

## 8. Latency Budget (targets, M1 Max)

| Stage | Conversation | Vision query |
|---|---|---|
| VAD end-of-utterance | 0.5 s | 0.5 s |
| ASR (local, Metal) | 1–2 s | 1–2 s |
| LLM (Qwen3-VL 8B Q4, short reply) | 1.5–3 s | 3–4 s (image prefill) |
| TTS (Parler-TTS, MPS) | 1–3 s | 1–3 s |
| **Total** | **≤ 8 s** | **≤ 10 s** |

Levers if over budget: sentence-streamed TTS (start speaking on first sentence), smaller Whisper for en/kn, VITS-based Indic-TTS, keeping the Ollama model resident (`keep_alive`) to avoid reload latency.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | **Local-model Sanskrit quality** — an 8B open model's Sanskrit is markedly weaker than frontier cloud models; grammar/vocabulary errors likely | Robot teaches wrong Sanskrit | Few-shot prompt of verified exchanges (FR-3.4); output validation + retry (FR-3.5); human-verified lexicon cache wins over generation (FR-2.5/2.6); simple-register constraint; evaluate Qwen3-VL 32B / Gemma 3 12B in Phase 3; optional cloud fallback if a key is ever available (FR-6.3) |
| R2 | **Open-vocab Sanskrit naming errors** — invented or awkward coinages | Teaches wrong words | Pre-seeded verified lexicon (FR-2.6); cache-first answers; honesty instruction (FR-2.2); operator can correct cache entries |
| R3 | **TTS pronunciation of rare words**, and Parler-TTS speed on MPS is unproven | Garbled or slow speech | Prefer simple vocabulary; test lexicon top-100 words and measure TTS latency in Phase 2; VITS fallback ready |
| R4 | Wake-word false accepts/rejects for a custom word | Annoyance / unresponsiveness | Train openWakeWord on synthetic "mitram" variants (speaker/accent/noise); Porcupine fallback if accuracy < FR-1.4 |
| R5 | **Memory pressure** — ~13.5 GB resident models + pipeline on a 32 GB shared-memory machine also used for development | Swapping, latency spikes | Memory budget (§3); load Sanskrit-ASR fine-tune lazily; unload nothing mid-session but allow single-model mode for development |
| R6 | Reachy Mini Lite 2-mic far-field pickup | Poor ASR at distance | Specify ≤ 2 m interaction distance; evaluate simple noise suppression (RNNoise) |
| R7 | **Sanskrit ASR quality** — fine-tunes are research-grade | Users speaking Sanskrit are misheard | Bilingual bridge means English/Kannada input always works; treat Sanskrit input as progressive enhancement; LLM can repair noisy transcripts from context |

## 10. Phased Plan & Acceptance Criteria

**Phase 0 — Bring-up (week 1):** Reachy Mini Lite connected; SDK smoke tests (camera frame, speaker tone, nod). Ollama + Qwen3-VL 8B installed; measure tokens/sec and memory on the M1 Max. ✅ *Scripted demo runs end-to-end on the host; LLM benchmark recorded.*

**Phase 1 — Wake + speech loop (weeks 2–3):** "mitram" wake word, VAD, ASR (English), Indic Parler-TTS Sanskrit output; robot nods and greets on wake. ✅ *FR-1.4 accuracy met; say "mitram", ask in English, hear any fixed Sanskrit reply in ≤ 8 s.*

**Phase 2 — Object naming (weeks 4–5):** Qwen3-VL vision integration, Sanskrit naming prompt, pre-seeded lexicon + cache. ✅ *20-object live test: ≥ 16 correctly identified; Sanskrit names verified by a Sanskrit-knowing reviewer; ≤ 10 s.*

**Phase 3 — Conversation (weeks 6–7):** Strands agent (Ollama provider) with tools, multi-turn context, language detection, Kannada + experimental Sanskrit ASR; **Sanskrit quality bake-off** between Qwen3-VL 8B / Qwen3-VL 32B / Gemma 3 12B on a fixed prompt set scored by a Sanskrit reviewer. ✅ *5-turn mixed English/Kannada conversation with coherent Sanskrit replies; model choice locked with recorded scores.*

**Phase 4 — Hardening (week 8):** Error paths (FR-6.4), latency tuning (streamed TTS), memory profiling, logging polish, README + demo script. ✅ *30-minute unattended offline demo (Wi-Fi off) without crash.*

## 11. Open Questions

1. Which local model wins the Phase 3 Sanskrit bake-off — Qwen3-VL 8B, Qwen3-VL 32B (memory-tight), or Gemma 3 12B (needs orchestrator-mediated tools)?
2. Which Sanskrit ASR checkpoint performs best on conversational (non-Vedic) speech? (Evaluate in Phase 3.)
3. Is Parler-TTS latency on MPS acceptable, or does v1 ship with the lighter VITS Indic-TTS? (Measure in Phase 2.)
4. Should the vision flow trigger on question intent only, or also proactively when an object is held up close? (v1: question intent only.)
5. Sound-source localization on the Lite's 2-mic array (FR-5.2) — feasible or wireless-only? Check SDK capabilities in Phase 0.
